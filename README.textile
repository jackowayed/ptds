h1. Good Python (name probably changing)

This rids Python of its whitespace-activeness. 

It is *very much* a work in progrses.

For now, you must end the line with "do" to get it to indent and have a line of "end" to get it to unindent. 

Improvements (running straight from it without compiling first, better syntax) are coming shortly.
