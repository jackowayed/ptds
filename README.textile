h1. Good Python (name probably changing)

This rids Python of its whitespace-activeness. 

It is *very much* a work in progrses.

This basically works. To get it to indent, you have to either start a line with one of:

* def
* if
* else
* for
* class
* try
* while

or end the line with do. 

To get it to unindent, you have to have a line just saying "end".

There are a couple more keywords I need to handle, which are coming soon. 

h2. Install

Either clone the repo or just download the goodpy.rb file. Then, wherever goodpy.rb is, run:

<pre><code>
chmod +x goodpy.rb
sudo cp goodpy.rb /usr/bin/goodpy
</code></pre>

Instead of /usr/bin/, you can put it in anywhere that is in your $PATH. 

h2. Usage

To simply run the file, run

<pre><code>
goodpy --flags --for --python code.gpy
</code></pre>

where code.gpy is the file. --flags --for --python will get passed to python. 

To "compile" it to a python file, run

<pre><code>
goodpy --compile code.gpy > code.py
</code></pre>

Where code.py is the destination file. You may also use -c instead of --compile.
